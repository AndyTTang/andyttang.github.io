Website that hosts my portfolio and projects.

This is more of a personal project that I will use as a self reference on web development.
There will be many extraneous comments.

The goal of this project is to create a decent website while learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Additional learning along the way may include:
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- AngularJS


As a reference, all learnings will be coming from w3schools.com

Credits:
orderedlist(https://github.com/orderedlist) - for allowing me to start with a built in theme.
